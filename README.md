# Portfolio

A Portfolio Containing my Programming Projects from Summer 2020 to Summer 2021
- Saketh Kamuju

Contents:
- Flask Project (Hackathon):
Prototype Flask Application Created for an Ecommerce Idea called Vault Operations.
Linked to a Mongo DB Database containing a user database and Product Library.

- Schoolwork:
Various school projects included to help affirm my grasp on basic to moderate Python

- Data Structures and Algorithms Work:
Various Python files created by me with occasional help from others dealing with various Data Structures and Algorithms.
Some files are from private practice while others were used in Algorithm competitions such as USACO.
Files pertaining to specific competition questions will have linked problems or descriptions.

- A Study in the Efficacy of Neural Networks in the Stock Market:
 Worked with Colombia PhD Yin Yiqiao in designing a Portfolio Management Model built with a Recurrent Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning Algorithm.
 The Model operates using the Monte Carlo Tree Search with the RNN to predict the price of a stock and choose to buy, sell, or hold accordingly.
 Utilized the model to accurately predict the price of a stock in the future and analyzed the machinations of the model in a research paper.
 Hopefully will be presented in an Analytical Research Paper under submission to an academic journal.
