This image is a screenshot of the result of running the current code in pfm_bot.py. It is an example
of the first branch in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). A MCTS operates by slowly honing down on 
variables by creating random pathways and checking which path generated data closest to reality.
For the purposes of my bot I am attempting to find the mean and standard deviation of the returns of
the Microsoft Stock to later predict the price.
