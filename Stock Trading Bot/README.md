As of right now, the Stock trading Bot is roughly half of the way through. The next step is to implement the 
Recurrent Neural Networks to address a fallacy made in our use of the Monte Carlo Tree Search. (see main 
README). When using the MCTS, we assume that the distribution of the Stock Data is normal, which may not be the
case in real life. Therefore, to alleviate this problem, we can utilize a Reccurrent Neural Network, which is 
the ideal Neural Network Model for dealing with time series data and Markov Chain models to genereate a mean value
to plug into our MCTS instead of assuming Standard distribution. As mentioned earlier, this step is under progress.
